If you're a first-time contributor, we recommend starting with issues labeled "good-first-issue" or "help-wanted", see [issue list](https://github.com/bytedance/bolt/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22)

## Development Environment Setup

Bolt uses Conan for dependency management and a Makefile to drive its build and test processes. Follow these steps to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 7+). macOS is currently experimental.

- **Compiler**: GCC 10+ or Clang 12+ (C++17 support required).

- **Build Tools**: CMake 3.25+, Ninja.

- **Dependency Manager**: Conan 2.


### Setup Development Environment On Linux

Run the following script to check your compiler, install Conan, configure its profile, and import dependency recipes into your local cache:

```Bash
scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
```

This script will:

- Check for a compatible compiler version (GCC 10/11/12 or Clang 16).

- Install Conan and `pydot`, then create/adjust the default profile (setting the C++ standard to `gnu17` from `gnu14`).

- Call `scripts/install-bolt-deps.sh` to export recipes for dependencies like folly, arrow, sonic-cpp, ryu, roaring, utf8proc, date, and llvm-core to your local Conan cache.


**Note**: The first-time build will compile dependencies from source and cache them, which can be time-consuming. You can set up your own Conan remote to speed up builds.


### Setup Development Environment on MacOS

This guide outlines the steps to compile and build Bolt directly on macOS.
You can follow the following steps
1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools

```Bash
xcode-select --install
```
2. Install Conan and Pydot

```Bash
pip install conan
pip install pydot
```

3. Run the provided script to install Bolt's specific dependencies.

```Bash
scripts/install-bolt-deps.sh
```

4. Install CMake
   We recommend using CMake version 3.25 or higher. Not using CMake 4.0 or higher may cause some third-party dependencies build failure.
   Download the macOS installer (.dmg) directly from the official website and install it.
* Download Link: https://cmake.org/download/
  Note: After installation, ensure the cmake command is available in your terminal path. You may need to follow the instructions in the installer to add it to your system PATH.

5. Configure Conan Profile
   Detect and generate the default Conan profile for your machine.

```bash
conan profile detect
```

## Fork and PR Workflow

We follow the standard GitHub fork-and-PR workflow. For details, please refer to [workflow](./doc/workflow.md):

1. **Fork** the `bytedance/bolt` repository to your personal GitHub account.

2. **Clone** your fork locally and create a new topic branch from your target branch (usually `main`).

3. **Develop and commit** your changes on the topic branch. Each commit should represent a logical unit of work.

4. **Push** the topic branch to your remote fork.

5. **Open a** **pull request** to the upstream repository with a clear title and description.


## Building and Testing

Bolt's build and test workflows are centralized in the root Makefile. You can run `make help` to see all common targets and their descriptions.

### Common Targets

```Bash
# Standard builds (for presto)
make debug        # Build a debug version
make release      # Build an optimized release version

# Build with tests and run them
make release_with_test       # Build a release version with tests enabled
make unittest                # Run unit tests in the debug build directory
make unittest_release        # Run unit tests in the release build directory

# Code coverage (requires a debug build with coverage flags)
make unittest_coverage

# Example build for Spark/Gluten (see README)
make release_spark
```

**Notes**:

- Build artifacts are placed in `_build/<BuildType>` (e.g., `_build/Release`).

- Unit tests are driven by CTest (using GoogleTest). `make unittest[_release]` invokes `ctest` in the corresponding build directory.

- You can set variables like `BUILD_VERSION` and `FILE_SYSTEM` as needed (see the Makefile for details). For example:


```Bash
make release_spark BUILD_VERSION=main
```


### Working with IDE

Vscode guide in [English](./doc/vscode-config-en.md) or [Chinese](./doc/vscode-config.md).

## Code Style and Static Analysis

To maintain consistent code quality and style, please run the following checks before submitting your changes.

- **C++ Standard**: We use **C++17**.

- **Formatting**: We use `clang-format-14`.

- **Naming**: Follow the [Style Guide](./doc/coding-style.md).


### Formatting (clang-format)

Bolt uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to manage all git hooks, so clang-format checks/formatting can also be done within `pre-commit`.

If you have executed `scripts/setup-dev-env.sh`, then `pre-commit` and all the pre-defined git hooks are already installed. When you commit code using `git commit ...`, clang-format will be executed automatically, you only need to `git add ...` the formatted file again.

By the way, you can execute `pre-commit install` to install all git hooks manually.

You also can use below command to format manually, but please ensure clang-format version is equal to `14.0.6`. Different version clang-format may has different default behavior.

```Bash
# Run the format check (same as in CI)
make clang-format-check

# format on a single file
clang-format -i -style=file path/to/your/file.cpp

# format all files in batch
find bolt -name "*.h" -o -name "*.cpp" | xargs clang-format -i -style=file
```

### Static Analysis (clang-tidy)

The repository provides a `.clang-tidy` configuration and a helper script at `scripts/run-clang-tidy.py`. It's best to run this after a successful build, as it relies on the compilation database in `-p=build/release/`.

```Bash
# First, create a release build to generate the compile database
make release

# Run clang-tidy on specific files (reports issues without fixing)
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py bolt/path/to/*.cpp bolt/other/path/*.h

# Check only the lines changed in the last commit (more focused)
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py --commit HEAD~1 bolt/path/to/*.cpp

# Automatically apply fixes (use with caution and review changes)
python3 scripts/run-clang-tidy.py --fix bolt/path/to/*.cpp
```

The script uses different check sets for test and main code. Please ensure your changes introduce no new warnings before committing.

### Code of Conduct

The Bolt project and all its contributors are governed by a [Code of Conduct.](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html) By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Unit Testing

- **Framework**: We use GoogleTest (see `bolt/bolt/expression/tests/*` for example).

- **Coverage**: Bug fixes and new features must be accompanied by minimal, reproducible unit tests with sufficient assertions. Avoid flaky tests or those with external dependencies.

- **Location**: Place test files in the `tests` directory of the corresponding module, following existing naming and structure conventions.

- **Execution**:


```Bash
make unittest           # Build in debug and run ctest in _build/Debug
make unittest_release   # Build in release and run ctest in _build/Release
make unittest_coverage  # generate a coverage report
make unittest_release_spark # Tests in Spark

# run a specific test
cd bolt/_build/Release/bolt/functions/sparksql/tests
./velox_functions_spark_test --gtest_filter=SparkCastExprTest.stringToTimestamp
```

### Sanitizers (Crucial for C++)

Before submitting a complex PR, it is highly recommended to run tests with AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSAN) to catch memory leaks and undefined behaviors.

```Bash
ENABLE_ASAN=True make unittest_release
```

## Copyright and Licensing

- **License**: Apache 2.0 (see `LICENSE` and `NOTICE.txt`).

- **Headers**: All new source files must include the Apache 2.0 license header. You can copy it from the `license.header` template file and paste it (as a comment) at the top of all source code files.


## Getting Help

- **Questions and** **Feedback**: Open an issue on GitHub with your environment details, reproduction steps, and logs.

- **Usage and Development Discussions**: Refer to the `README.md` and this guide. If we open a discussion forum or chat channel, we will announce it in the README.
